# Deep-Learning

## This repository contains jupyter notebooks which pertain to implementation of topics in deep learning using Python, such as:

1. Implementing Gradient Descent and its types
2. AdaGrad implementation
3. Image reconstruction using PCA
4. Autoencoder for binary and real-valued inputs
5. Backpropagation (iris dataset)
6. L1, L2 regularisation using early stopping and dropout, on SONAR dataset
7. Implementation of Autoencoder, LeNet5, VGG16, AlexNet on MNIST Dataset
8. RNN and LSTM on Sun spot dataset

For almost every model, the accuracies are compared to show the best model for each dataset and objective.
